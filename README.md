## Description

StickDots is a Project desgined for VFS-PG25 to work togeather to create a ship ready mobile. 

## Features

- Allow players to dynamically draw lines between dots in real-time. As a player clicks and drags from one dot to another, a line visually extends from the starting dot to the cursor's position.

- Once all four sides of a square are captured, that square will be owned by the player, increasing that player's score and allowing them an extra turn.
